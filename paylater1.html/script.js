The provided text describes a design, not JavaScript code.  I cannot generate JavaScript code based solely on a description of visual elements and layout. To create interactive elements with smooth animations and responsive behaviors, I need more specific details about the desired functionality and interactions.  For example:

* **What should happen when the "Complete Payment" button is clicked?**  (e.g., redirect to a payment page, show a confirmation message, etc.)
* **What kind of animations are desired?** (e.g., fade-in effects, transitions, etc.)
* **What specific responsive behaviors are needed?** (e.g., changes in layout at different screen sizes, hiding/showing elements, etc.)
* **What HTML structure will the JavaScript interact with?**  I need the HTML to attach event listeners and manipulate the DOM.


Once you provide these details, I can generate the relevant JavaScript code.  I can use modern JavaScript (ES6+), event listeners, and libraries like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth animations if you wish.  However, note that I cannot directly import external libraries here. I can provide the JavaScript code assuming you will include GSAP separately or use built-in animation capabilities.
